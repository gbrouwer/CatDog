CatDog Project

1. Project Overview
The CatDog Project is a distributed, modular system designed to facilitate seamless communication between various hardware and software modules across multiple devices. Its primary goal is to create an intelligent, responsive environment where modules can interact autonomously, yet remain coordinated through a central control mechanism.
Key Objectives:
•	Modularity: Each component operates independently, allowing for easy addition, removal, or modification.
•	Scalability: The system can effortlessly scale across multiple devices and networks.
•	Resilience: Built-in mechanisms ensure fault tolerance and system robustness.
•	Real-time Communication: Modules communicate in real-time, ensuring timely responses to environmental changes.

2. Philosophy Behind the Project
The CatDog Project is grounded in several core philosophical principles:
a. Decentralized Autonomy with Central Coordination
While each module operates autonomously, a central agent ensures overall system harmony. This balance allows for flexibility at the module level and coherence at the system level.
b. Event-Driven Architecture
The system emphasizes the importance of state transitions (e.g., object entering or exiting a sensor's range) over static states. This approach ensures that the system reacts to meaningful changes in the environment.
c. Abstraction and Encapsulation
Modules are designed to be unaware of the specific nature of the data they process. For instance, a sound emitter doesn't need to know that a signal represents a distance measurement; it only reacts to the signal's strength relative to a threshold.
d. Simplicity and Clarity
The design favors straightforward solutions, avoiding unnecessary complexity. This principle ensures maintainability and ease of understanding for future developers.

3. Translating Philosophy into Implementation
The project's philosophy manifests in its architecture, processes, classes, and functions:
a. Modular Design
Each module (e.g., sensors, actuators) is a self-contained Python script with defined interfaces. Modules communicate via WebSockets, ensuring loose coupling and high cohesion.
b. Global Communication Channel (GCC)
A central WebSocket server facilitates communication between modules. Modules send heartbeats and data to the GCC, which then routes messages appropriately.
c. Vibing System
This subsystem monitors the health and presence of devices in the network. Devices broadcast "vibes" (heartbeat messages) over UDP, allowing the system to detect new devices and monitor existing ones.
d. Agent Script
The agent script serves as the system's orchestrator. It reads a configuration file, launches local modules, and initiates ephemeral agents on remote devices. The agent ensures that each device runs only the modules assigned to it.
e. Event Handling
Modules focus on detecting transitions rather than continuous states. For example, a sensor module triggers events when an object enters or exits its detection range, rather than continuously reporting distances.

4. Detailed Overview of the Existing Codebase
a. agent.py
•	Purpose: Orchestrates the system by launching modules based on a configuration file.
•	Key Functions:
o	main(): Parses arguments, reads configuration, and initiates module launches.
o	launch_local_module(): Starts a module on the local device.
o	launch_ephemeral_agent(): Initiates an agent on a remote device via SSH.
b. launcher.py
•	Purpose: Launches individual modules.
•	Key Functions:
o	Parses command-line arguments to identify the module and its parameters.
o	Dynamically imports and starts the specified module.
c. vibes.py
•	Purpose: Manages the vibing system for device health monitoring.
•	Key Classes:
o	VibeSender: Periodically broadcasts heartbeat messages over UDP.
o	VibeListener: Listens for incoming vibes and updates the device status map.
d. global_channel.py
•	Purpose: Implements the Global Communication Channel.
•	Key Functions:
o	Sets up a WebSocket server to handle incoming connections from modules.
o	Routes messages between modules based on predefined rules.
e. Modules
Each module resides in its respective directory, following a consistent structure:
•	Sensors:
o	ultrasonic_sensor.py: Measures distances using ultrasonic waves and sends data to the GCC.
•	Actuators:
o	sound_emitter.py: Emits sounds based on signals received from sensors.
Modules implement standard methods:
•	boot(): Initializes the module.
•	start(): Begins the module's main functionality.
•	on_threshold_enter(): Triggered when a signal crosses a predefined threshold.
•	on_threshold_exit(): Triggered when a signal falls below the threshold.
f. Configuration File (catdog_system.yaml)
Defines the system's structure, specifying devices, their IPs, and the modules assigned to each.
